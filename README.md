# instagratBlock
A simple webextension that allows you to block those instant gratification websites that keep on stealing your valuable time.

*([LeechBlock](http://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/) is similar, but much more configurable)*

**Download and install now from the [Firefox Add-On repository](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/instagratblock/)**

A grey pie should show up in your menubar. Navigate to the offending site, browse it, then, once you're thinking that you really have to get back to work/study/vacuuming, click on the icon, enter the time you want it to be blocked and hit `Enter`. You simply will not be able to see that site again until the block expires.
