# instagratBlock
A simple webextension that allows you to block those instant gratification websites that keep on stealing your valuable time.

*([LeechBlock](http://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/) is similar, but much more configurable)*

To install the code temporarily,

1. Clone the repository into a folder of your liking
2. In Firefox (â‰¥ 48.0), go to `about:debugging`
3. Click `Load Temporary Add-on`, locate the folder and double-click `manifest.json`

A grey pie should show up in your menubar. Navigate to the offending site, browse it, then, once you're thinking that you really have to get back to work/study/vacuuming, click on the icon, enter the time you want it to be blocked and hit `Enter`. You simply will not be able to see that site again until the block expires.

Disclaimer: not everything is working right now as it should, the code is still a bit messy, though very simple, and the design lacks. If you want to have another thing you can use to procrastinate, feel free to contribute to this repository (issues, pull requests etc.).
